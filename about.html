                    <h2>My Journey To Programming</h2>
                    <p>

                    In the spirit of online honesty I’ll tell you I was born in 1993 so I'm deeply guilty of being a Millennial. Now that that's off my chest, I’m really just a guy who loves technology. I was raised in a few different small towns in Northern California, I would call Mariposa my home. As a youngster I didn’t understand the first thing about technology, I never even questioned it. My quest to a love of tech began with graphic design. I wanted to make the web a better place. I loved the innovations in design that companies like Apple was making with the iOS and MacOS interfaces and Google with Material Design. I saw websites that were difficult to use and felt like I could do something about it through design. So I started learning. I started out as a whole hearted designer but over the course of a few years as I learned web languages to implement my designs I started to love coding more than designing. Sometime in about 2014 I reached a point where I was completely done with design, coding had become my true love.

                    Since that turning point I’ve had the privilege to work on some amazing projects with some amazing people. Now, I write design and implement web solutions from end to end. I wouldn’t call myself an expert in anything but there isn’t a lot of mainstream web related technologies I haven’t had my hands on at some point or another.

                  <h2>Me Personally</h2>
                  <p>

                    Along with software, I love basketball, fancy cheeses, my amazing life partner Taylor, my dog, pokemon, sci-fi tv, my car, Overwatch &amp; Destiny, and the ocean. A great day for me is when I can mix as many of these passions as possible. I don’t have an Instagram, Snapchat, or anything else like that (I grew up in the woods) so here are a few pictures.

                  <h2>Me As A Programmer</h2>
                  <p>

                    I am extremely passionate about upholding the best practices end to end. I’ve worked on projects where every line was developed and styled with care and other projects where script kitties threw a page together and then spent years duck taping new features onto it in the quickest way possible until it was 10 thousand lines of filth. I’ve seen enough of the later to know that it’s a detriment to the product, the developers, the company, and the end user. However, I do realize not all projects have infinite time and capital...So, I try to write readable code that does its job and most importantly never ever outsmart my own common sense with outrageous logic.
