  Learning to program is a huge task and most people get lost 
  in the hundreds of libraries, languages, framewords, and random 
  technologies. In reality, nobody knows it all and neither should you.

I'm going to break learning to program into two key steps.

1. Learn to learn to code
2. Learn to code

Step one is often more difficult, it was for me. Learning to code is easy and fun and addicting. The problem 
is before you can get there you have to know what your aiming to learn. How can you know something you 
dont know? You can't, thats why I'm here to help.

## Not all Programmers are the same
The first thing to know is that two people both be programmers but they could have no idea how to do the others 
job. Think of two construction workers, one is a welder who works hanging upside down underwater in a scuba suit
building tunnels. The other is a framer who works hanging of walls nailing together wood beams in his tank top to
make buildings. Its not likely that these two could do each others jobs. More importantly they probably wouldn't
want to!
