  Users don't want to be confused but they also don't want
  to be bombarded with so many directions its even more
  confusing. Let's find a balance. Hint: Intuitive wins.

> The Problem
Designers and Project Managers are scared that the end user won't
understand the tool so they 'hand hold' them and in the end they actually diminish
the usability and then the value of the product.




> Explain the Spectrums
Explicit Design and Intuitive Design


> Explicit Design
A design that tells the user every single action possible action and makes
sure that anything the user might ask, wonder, or want to know is made
explicitly available

    > Example: Apple, gestures


> Intuitive Design:
A design that expects the user to have a level of inteligence as a baseline
so the design begins from that point

    > Example: {{  }}


> Analogy
You purchase a new car. The first time you get in it and turn the key on and
a voice comes over the stereo and begins to tell you about your new car. It tells you
how the door works, how the steering wheel works, how the air, the gas, the lights,
the wheels, the brakes, and everything else work. Then everytime you got in your new
car from then on it would reciet to you every one of its functions.


> Point out this is obviously not ideal


> The Solution
    > Respectfully expect a basic level of intelegence from your users
    > Dont be afraid for them to get confused
    > If something is really complex, so complex it needs to be explained - explain it ONCE
    > Make explanations available
    > Keep a consistant design
    > Keep your design intuitive
