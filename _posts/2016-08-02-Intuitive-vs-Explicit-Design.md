  Users don't want to be confused but they also don't want
  to be bombarded with so many directions its even more
  confusing. Let's find a balance.

There is a problem with a lot of designs I see: they are so well explained they're hard to use. Ironic right. The root of this is designers/leads that haven't developed a certain level of trust in the end user. Without this trust the end user gets treated like he/she has a 4th grade education. I think we can all easily agree that nothing in life is very enjoyable when we get treated like were stupid. So, lets identify the problem and create some guidelines to enhance our designs and promote products that are in fact easier and far more enjoyable to use.


First we need to understand the two sides of the spectrums that any design is going to reside on or between. I'll give a quick definition of design at the two most drastic points on the spectrum: complete explicit and complete intuitive.


### Explicit Design
Labels on everything, titles with subtitles with sub-subtitles, and overwhelming 'help' screens are a few results of explicit design. From an experience point of view this often turns into a stale, uneventful, boring, and frustrating experience.


#### The Danger
When we begin to use an absolute explicit design we assume that the end user is an idiot. No, a complete moron. This is bad because in reality the user is not an idiot. As a note, if you believe your user is an idiot then you need to stop. It will cause you a lot of pain.

#### Common Cause
The most common cause I see to a smothering explicit design is when the end user market is heavily populated by an older generation. Now, I understand the fear. Even better, I truly sympathize. The more advanced in age crowd have a tendency to never understand the technology they use. No, thats a lie, don't believe it.


### Intuitive Design
An intuitive design relies less on labels, icons, and explanations and relies more on leveraging the users knowledge of real world relationships. That didn't make since did it? Try this, in the real world we can all look at a file cabinet and automatically (intuitively) know that there will be folders inside that contain files. To get to a file we'll need to open the cabinet, open a folder, and pull out a file. During the dawn of the computer some brilliant people decided to use this model to represent an abstract concept in the new digital world. If you really look at your computer you'll find a plethora of examples like this. The reason being is that companies like Apple and Microsoft work hard to leverage the knowledge of the real world a common user has then implement abstract digital designs in a relatively similar way.

#### The Danger
If you grew up using Windows (generally a more explicitly designed OS) and then made the switch to Macintosh (generally a more intuitively designed OS) you have felt the pain of wondering things like "where is this?", "where is that?", "what will this do?...", "how so I do what I want to?", and always "where is the button that does what I want?". I'm not saying Apple did a bad job, I love Apple. The danger with an absolutely intuitively designed product is that users will give up before they make the break through to full usage. This is often because you left them out to dry, to figure out the product all on their own. Damn you...

#### Common Cause
Getting to close. I have had this problem and it has lead to some well needed refactoring of great designs to give them better experiences. When a designer gets to close to his design he/she starts to think that its totally understood, fully usable, and completely explained. In all fairness it is, but only to that designer.

### The Effect On The User
You buy a new car. When getting into the car, inserting the key, and turning on your new toy it begins to speak to you. It says

> Hello, my name is Danika. I'm a 2016 Tesla Model S. My top speed is 170 miles per hour. Allow me to walk you through correct operation of my features. The brakes should be applied with the right foot on a need only basis and always done with sensitivity to avoid a loss of control. The steering wheel should be held with two hands at all times and rotated gently to the right and left in order to alter the direction of the wheels.

and so on as it goes through every available feature, its proper use, and your correct participation in its function.

Possibly, if your a very patient person, this first explosion of information is an interesting and maybe even educational event. However, what about the next time? How about a week from now? Imagine your Tesla gives you this 20 minute long speech every single time you used it.

#### Applying This Effect to User Lifecycle
An intuitive design tends to be more difficult to get users to accept in the early stages but then increasingly usable through later stages of its lifecycle. In an opposite fashion, an explicit design is easier to use on day one and then becomes more and more frustrating for the user as time goes on.
