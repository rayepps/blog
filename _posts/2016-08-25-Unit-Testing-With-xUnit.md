For a long time I shied away from learning and using any kind of testing in my projects because I knew so little about it. Let me tell you now, if you are staying away from anything, especially testing, because you feel scared: stop. Get your hands on it doing anything you can and become at least comfortable. An engineer that can write good tests is an invaluable member of the team. So in the interest of being sure we all have a foundation of knowledge to allow lets go over the basics of the code, methodology, and best practices for unit testing.
